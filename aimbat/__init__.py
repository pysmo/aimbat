AIMBAT
======

AIMBAT (Automated and Interactive Measurement of Body wave Arrival Times)
is an open-source software package for efficiently measuring teleseismic
body wave arrival times for large seismic arrays (Lou et al., 2012). It is
based on a widely used method called MCCC (Multi-Channel Cross-Correlation)
developed by VanDecar and Crosson (1990). The package is automated in the
sense of initially aligning seismograms for MCCC which is achieved by an
ICCS (Iterative Cross Correlation and Stack) algorithm. Meanwhile, a
graphical user interface is built to perform seismogram quality control
interactively. Therefore, user processing time is reduced while valuable
input from a user\'s expertise is retained. As a byproduct, SAC (Goldstein
et al., 2003) plotting and phase picking functionalities are replicated
and enhanced.
