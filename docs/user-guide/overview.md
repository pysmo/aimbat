# Using AIMBAT

Once [installed](../first-steps/installation.md), AIMBAT can be used in several ways:

- As a [command line](cli.md) application.
- Within a [notebook](/examples/tutorial)[^notebook].
- As a [GUI](gui.md) (graphical user interface) application.

[^notebook]: [Jupyter Lab/Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is *not* bundled with AIMBAT.

Complete walkthroughs for each of these options are presented in the following sections.

!!! tip

    AIMBAT project files are independent of user interface. In other words,
    existing projects can be opened in any way (cli, notebook, gui).
