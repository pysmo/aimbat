# Data

AIMBAT projects are created from [seismogram files](data.md#seismogram-files).
Event and station information, as well as initial arrival time picks are read from
these files to populate the AIMBAT [project file](data.md#project-file). The majority
of operations within AIMBAT exclusively use the project file. The contents of the
seismogram files are never modified by AIMBAT.

## Seismogram files

AIMBAT uses [SAC](https://ds.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/) files as input. Before adding
files to an AIMBAT project please ensure the following header fields are set
correctly in all files:

- Seismogram begin time (SAC header *B*).
- Seismogram reference time (*KZTIME*) and date (*KZDATE*).
- Station name (*KSTNM*), latitude (*STLA*) and longitude *STLO*).
- Event origin time (*O*), latitude (*EVLA*) and longitude (*EVLO*).

To detect any potential problems with the data before importing them into AIMBAT,
you can use the AIMBAT cli:

<!-- termynal -->

```bash
$ aimbat checkdata *.BHZ
sacfile_01.BHZ: ✓✓✓
sacfile_02.BHZ: ✓✓✓
sacfile_03.BHZ: ✓✓✓
sacfile_04.BHZ: ✓✓✓
sacfile_05.BHZ: ✓✓✓
sacfile_06.BHZ: ✓✓✓
sacfile_07.BHZ: ✓✓✓
sacfile_08.BHZ: ✓✓✓
sacfile_09.BHZ: ✓✓✓
sacfile_10.BHZ: ✓✓✓
sacfile_11.BHZ: ✓✓✓
...
sacfile_NN.BHZ: ✓✓✓

No issues found!
```

The seismogram files can be stored in an arbitrary directory (i.e. they do not
necessarily need to be stored together with an AIMBAT project file).

!!! warning

    After importing files into an AIMBAT project, their location (and contents)
    should not be changed!

## Project file

AIMBAT projects consist of a single
[sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org){ target="_blank" } file (which is automatically
generated when a new project is created). This file contains a database to manage
all aspects of an AIMBAT project. Understanding the internals of this file is not
particularly important for normal AIMBAT usage, though it might be useful to look
at the data directly in cases where AIMBAT behaves in unexpected ways (e.g. due
to inconsistencies in the seismogram files used as input). To do this we suggest
viewing the database in tools such as
[DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org){ target="_blank" }.
