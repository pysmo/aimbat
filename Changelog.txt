aimbat-v0.3-alpha1
============
June 3, 2018
* Upgrade to python3 (May not back-compatible with python2). No change in functionalities from v0.2.

aimbat-v1.0.0
============
Dec 3, 2018
* Use new pysmo.core.sac.SacIO (pysmo-pysmo-v0.7.0) instead of pysmo.sac.sacio.SacFile
* New setup.py:
  ** Wrap all scripts into a callable function and add them to entry_point, e.g.,
     aimbat-ttpick is automatically generated in your bin folder.
  ** Use git commit/tag to determine version automatically.
* SAC plotting and aimbat-ttpick are still using Matplotlib GUI.
* New GUI (aimbat-qtpick) using pyqtgraph for fast plotting. Similar user interactions as v0.3:
  ** Key pressed event handler in pyqtgraph is redefined 
  ** Use mouse to change time window and press key 'w' to set <-- work on stack only
  ** Press key 't[0-9]' to set time picks like SAC PPK        <-- work on both stack and traces
  ** Mouse click on waveform to change trace selection status <-- work on trace only
* Better separation between data and plot.
* Filter and sort are both in the main GUI controlled by a parameter tree.

aimbat-v1.0.1
============
Dec 4, 2018
* Fix bugs in changing trace selection status (QC), manual phase picking, and trace label.
* Change in GUI settings. Using right button dragging is enough and give up on QScrollArea.
* In cross-correlation, do not allow reverse polarity which causes cycle skipping too often.

aimbat-v1.0.2
============
Dec 5, 2018
* Add option to plot simple delay time map by matplotlib.pyplot

aimbat-v1.0.3
============
Dec 7, 2018
* Some GUI setting changes

aimbat-v1.0.4
============
Dec 23, 2018
* Add SAC P1 Button to the main GUI
* Plot only a subset of traces for faster data QC and (de)selection. All labels are plotted. Add a button to plot more traces
